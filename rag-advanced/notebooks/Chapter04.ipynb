        "   - The QueryEnhancedRAGPipeline exhibited significantly higher latency (21.40s vs 5.74s).\n",
        "   - This increased latency is likely due to the additional processing in query enhancement.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Metric Limitations**:\n",
        "   The discrepancy between perceived quality and metric scores underscores the limitations of current evaluation methods. This suggests an opportunity to fine-tune the LLM Judge for more nuanced assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dataset Dependency**:\n",
